Drone Website Project

This project is a modern style website I created back in **June 2023** when I was exploring ideas for doing small projects with my drone.  
At the time, I wanted to experiment with **modern web design**, responsive layouts, and how a personal or business website could look if I ever decided to offer drone related services like aerial photography, video shoots, or creative drone edits.


About the Project
This was one of my early website projects and a way to learn how to structure a real-world business style site.

The idea was simple:  
a clean, visually appealing landing page that could represent a drone business or creative portfolio.

Notes
Even though it’s a simple project, it represents one of my first steps toward creating full websites for real purposes.  
It was a fun experiment that taught me a lot about web structure and style consistency.
